# batmapper
This repository contains code to build the batmapper plugin for batclient. ( http://www.bat.org/play/batclient )

# How to build & run it locally #
```
mvn clean install    

copy target/batUtils-1.3-full.jar into batclient/plugins directory    

start batclient    

```


# How to test the panels # 
The runnable TestClasses can be found under src/test/...
Simply run them as java apps

# How to contribute or give feedback #
Feel free to submit pull requests, there is lots of room for improvement. Preferably use the github issues etc   

If you feel you must, you can try to contact me ingame in batmud too, but I rarely spend time there,
